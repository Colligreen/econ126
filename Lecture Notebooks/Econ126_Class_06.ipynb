    "\n",
    "In their article \"The New Kaldor Facts: Ideas, Institutions, Population, and Human Capital\" in the January 2010 issue of the *American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics*, Charles Jones and Paul Romer document six empirical features about macroeconomics that are yet to be adequately explained by a general theory of economic growth (link to article: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25760291). Among these facts is the observation that total factor productivity is positively correlated with a country's GDP per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the Cobb-Douglas production function with human capital:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Y & = A K^{\\alpha}\\left(hL\\right)^{1-\\alpha}, \\label{eqn:production}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ denotes the production of final goods and services, $K$ is the stock of physical capital, $L$ is the labor force (either number of workers or number of worker hours), $h$ is human capital per worker, and $A$ is *total factor productivity* or TFP which represents all other factors that might affect production that are not captured by $K$, $L$, or $h$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most countries, we can measure $Y$, $K$, $L$ and $h$. Measurements may not be perfect; for example, we often associate $h$ with years of schooling in a country even though, strictly speaking, on-the-job experience and training also contribute to human capital accumulation. Regardless, the point is that the production function *implies* a value for TFP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "A & = \\frac{Y}{K^{\\alpha}(hL)^{1-\\alpha}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "TFP is like a residual in a linear regression: it is the part of production that is not explained by observable inputs for production. Remarkably, Jones and Romer show that TFP explains a lot of the variation in GDP per worker across countries. This fact is captured in Figure 1.\n",
